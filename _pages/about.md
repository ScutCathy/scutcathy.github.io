I am a Ph.D. student in Rutgers Data Mining and Business Analytics, working with my advisor [Prof. Hui Xiong](http://datamining.rutgers.edu/). My research interests lie in the general area of urban computing and financial applications, particularly in spatiotemporal analysis, meta learning, self-supervised learning, knowledge graphs, and probabilistic graphical models, as well as their applications in POI recommendation, quantitative trading, event-driven investing, and knowledge graph reasoning.
